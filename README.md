Fortress Blast
==============

Fortress Blast is a Team Fortress 2 server mod created by Naleksuh and Jack5 that adds powerups from the Marble Blast series into TF2. It can be run on top of any gamemodes and other mods, and supports server-defined locations for powerups to spawn in.

Features

Fortress Blast comes with a few quality-of-life features:

- A menu is available to in-game players with the command **!fortressblast**, which will provide them with information on what powerups are and tips on how they can be used. *(In development)*
