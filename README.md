**[Visit the wiki](https://github.com/Fortress-Blast/Fortress-Blast/wiki) for how to install Fortress Blast, as well as more in-depth information about the plugin.**

Fortress Blast is a SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2, created by Naleksuh and Jack5, that adds collectable powerups from the Marble Blast series and more into TF2. It can be run on top of other gamemodes and server mods. Fortress Blast is mostly dependent on user-defined spawning locations, but comes with support for some official maps, as well as an entire library of official and custom map support available in a separate repository.

A powerup bonanza!
------------------

The lifeblood of Fortress Blast is its powerups, and *here are just a few examples:*

- **Blast** - An explosion is emitted from the user, killing low-health enemies and harming others nearby.
- **Frost Touch** - For 8 seconds, when the user touches an enemy, they turn into an ice statue for 3 seconds.
- **Mega Mann** - The user becomes 75% larger and is overhealed to 4 times their current health for 10 seconds.
- **Super Bounce** - The user is forced to uncontrollably bunny hop for 5 seconds.
- **Time Travel** - The user is invisible, has increased speed and cannot attack for 3 seconds.

Heavily customisable!
---------------------

Fortress Blast comes with several quality-of-life features, *such as:*

- A MOTD is available to players, containing information on the plugin's controls and powerups.
- A server admin can allow players to drop Fortress Blast powerups on death with a ConVar.
- Bots can pick up powerups and randomly use them based on a user-defined range of time.
- By default, Mannpower powerups are replaced with Fortress Blast powerups.
- A debug ConVar is available to test the plugin without having to check the server console.
