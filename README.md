Fortress Blast is a Team Fortress 2 server mod created by Naleksuh and Jack5 that adds powerups from the Marble Blast series into TF2. It can be run on top of other gamemodes and server mods. Fortress Blast is mostly dependent on user-defined spawning locations, but comes packaged with support for many official and custom maps.

A powerup bonanza!
------------------

The lifeblood of Fortress Blast is its powerups, and *here are just a few examples:*

- **Blast** - An explosion is emitted from the user, killing low-health enemies and harming others nearby.
- **Frost Touch** - For 8 seconds, when the user touches an enemy, they turn into an ice statue for 3 seconds.
- **Mega Mann** - The user becomes 75% larger and is overhealed to 4 times their current health for 10 seconds.
- **Super Bounce** - The user is forced to uncontrollably bunny hop for 5 seconds.
- **Time Travel** - The user is invisible, has increased speed and cannot attack for 3 seconds.

Heavily customisable!
---------------------

Fortress Blast comes with several quality-of-life features, *such as:*

- A MOTD is available to players, with information on what powerups there are, what they do, and how they can be used.
- A server admin can allow players to drop Fortress Blast powerups on death with a ConVar.
- Bots can pick up powerups and randomly use them based on a user-defined range of time.
- By default, Mannpower powerups are replaced with Fortress Blast powerups.
- Debug mode can be turned on to test functions of the server mod without having to look at the console.
