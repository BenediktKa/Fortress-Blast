Fortress Blast is a Team Fortress 2 server mod created by Naleksuh and Jack5 that adds powerups from the Marble Blast series onto user-defined locations. It can be used on top of other gamemodes.

Features
--------

Fortress Blast comes with a few quality-of-life features:

- A menu is available to in-gmae players with the command **!fortressblast**, which will provide them with information on what powerups are and tips on how they can be used. *(In development)*
- By default, Mannpower powerups are replaced with Fortress Blast powerups. This feature can be turned off with `undecided_cvar`. *(In development)*
- Players can drop Fortress Blast powerups on death if `undecided_cvar` is turned on. *(In development)*
